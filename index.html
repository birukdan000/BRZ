    <p> Peyton Manning is considered a top 3 quarterback of all time. He was a prolific passer in the pocket, and had the mind set
      unlike anyone before him. In his career he won 2 superbowls. The first was with the Colts, and the other with the Broncos.
      Manning was drafted first overall in the 1998 draft, by the Indianapolis Colts. In his rookie season he set a record that no one
      before has set, he threw the most interseption, by any rookie quarterback. He proved that he was good enough to start the next season
      and did well. He won his first superbowl in 2008, against the Chicago Bears, and his second in superbowl 50 with the Broncos, against
      Cam Newton, and the Panthers.</p>
